# City Builder Simulation


Welcome to our COS 214 **City Builder Simulation** project! 
Built as a 2nd year group project, this C++ simulation allows players to engage with various aspects of a virtual city, integrating key urban components like infrastructure, citizen satisfaction, resource management, and more. Designed with flexibility and scalability, this simulation employs numerous design patterns to achieve a complex, dynamic urban environment.
